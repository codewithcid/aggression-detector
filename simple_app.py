        **Simple Explanation:**
        This app uses artificial intelligence to analyze speech patterns in audio files. 
        It looks for vocal characteristics that are typically associated with aggressive behavior, 
        such as tone, pitch variations, and speaking patterns.
        
        **Technical Details:**
        - **Model Type:** Deep Neural Network trained on labeled audio data
        - **Input Features:** MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)
        - **Output:** Binary classification (Aggressive vs Non-aggressive)
        - **Training Data:** Various examples of aggressive and calm speech
        - **Accuracy:** Trained to detect patterns with high confidence
        
        **Important Notes:**
        - This is an AI prediction, not a definitive diagnosis
        - Results should be interpreted by qualified professionals
        - Use as a screening tool, not as the sole basis for decisions
